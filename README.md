Git Practice Repository
-----------------------

This repository and project are intended to serve as practice for the fork/pull request git workflow.
To get started, I recommend reading https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962, http://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/, and references therein.

Overview
--------
The references above (and slack, stack overflow, or other pages) can help you with how to execute these steps, so I'll give a very brief overview.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Find an issue you want to work. There is a variety of issues that should encompass multiple skill levels.
3. Make a branch on your repository for that specific issue.
4. Do the work (add the feature, fix the bug, etc.)
5. Add tests that demonstrate that you've fixed the bug or implemented the feature.
6. Issue a pull request from your branch to the master branch on the original repository.
7. Respond to any comments on the code review.

I highly encourage you to participate in the code review of other issues.
